HELLO!

	Thanks for trying out this Rainmeter skin! I must apologzize
	profusely for the amount of time it took. Creating the entire
	skin might have taken 30-40 hours (including teaching myself
	how to even use Rainmeter. Even so, it took way too lont to
	release. I posted a popular teaser of the skin a very long 
	time ago and it basically went silent after that. I don't want 
	to make excuses, but after having forgotten about the project, 
	I recently got a PM from another reddit user reminding me 
	about this, and so I hopped back on it. 
	I'd also like to thank you guys for giving me so many great
	ideas about what things to put where. It was difficult deciding
	what each meter would measure, but you guys came through with
	some stellar ideas (haha).
	So here is the product of my work. I hope you enjoy!

	
SET UP AND POSITIONING

	For those of you first time users of Rainmeter, it's pretty
	simple to set up. After installing the .rmskin to Rainmeter,
	it will probably load up a preset layout. To change the
	positions of the individual meters, just drag them into place.
	I expect that FTL players will remember the appropriate
	positions of the different meters. As long as you have the
	"Snap to edges" option on in the bottom right of the "Manage
	Rainmeter" window, repositioning should be a piece of cake.


CUSTOMIZING (BUT JUST A LITTLE)

	I tried to include at least a bit of customizing in terms of
	what the different meters measured. For example, you can
	display 2 drives instead of 4 if you don't think all 4 slots are
	necessary. If you don't have a laptop, your hull meter at the
	top left can display RAM or HDD space instead of remaining 
	power.


CREW SHORTCUTS
	
	All info you need about editing the crew shortcut paths, labels,
	and images is all in the setup file in FTL\Crew\Setup.inc. It
	can be opened with any text editor
	

FINISHING UP

	Make sure you have all of your meters right where you want them.
	Go through all of the meters you loaded, and change their
	settings (bottom right) so that their position is on the
	desktop, and they are not draggable.
